Description: Ultimate Movie Player For Linux.
 It plays most mpeg, avi and asf files, supported by many native and win32
 DLL codecs. You can watch VCD, DVD and even DivX movies too. The other
 big feature of mplayer is the wide range of supported output drivers. It
 works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, but you can use SDL (and
 this way all drivers of SDL) and some lowlevel card-specific drivers (for
 Matrox/3dfx/SiS) too! Most of them supports software or hardware scaling,
 so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen.
 .
 This version is for Hppa CPUs.
